//! Safe abstraction for [`libnftnl`]. Provides low-level userspace access to the in-kernel
//! nf_tables subsystem. See [`nftnl-sys`] for the low level FFI bindings to the C library.
//!
//! Can be used to create and remove tables, chains, sets and rules from the nftables firewall,
//! the successor to iptables.
//!
//! This library currently has quite rough edges and does not make adding and removing netfilter
//! entries super easy and elegant. That is partly because the library needs more work, but also
//! partly because nftables is super low level and extremely customizable, making it hard, and
//! probably wrong, to try and create a too simple/limited wrapper. See examples for inspiration.
//! One can also look at how the original project this crate was developed to support uses it:
//! [Mullvad VPN app](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app)
//!
//! Understanding how to use [`libnftnl`] and implementing this crate has mostly been done by
//! reading the source code for the [`nftables`] program and attaching debuggers to the `nft`
//! binary. Since the implementation is mostly based on trial and error, there might of course be
//! a number of places where the underlying library is used in an invalid or not intended way.
//! Large portions of [`libnftnl`] are also not covered yet. Contributions are welcome!
//!
//! # Selecting version of `libnftnl`
//!
//! See the documentation for the corresponding sys crate for details: [`nftnl-sys`]
//! This crate has the same features as the sys crate, and selecting version works the same.
